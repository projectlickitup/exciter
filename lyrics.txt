Oh, deep in the night I am waiting
Sent from above, power of love in my hand
And I know what you want, I know what you need
And I know what you feel
Lose all your fears, live out your dreams
I'm the one's gonna make it real
Passion and fire, lust and desire
Exciter
Pleasure and pain, this is my name
Exciter
Oh, heaven is yours for the taking
Power of love, sent from above in your hand
And I'll give you more than ever before
So take all you need
When you open your arms, open your eyes
I'm the one who's gonna make you see
Passion and fire, lust and desire
Exciter
Pleasure and pain, whisper my name
Exciter
Surrender to me, I'll guarantee
You'll pray that the night never ends
Come play the game, this is my name
Exciter...
Oh, hot
And I'll show you a world where you've never been
And it's time that you knew
There's no time for waiting, it's time to begin
I'm the one's gonna take you
Passion and fire, lust and desire
Exciter
Pleasure and pain, whisper my name
Exciter
Surrender to me, I'll guarantee
You'll pray that the night never ends
Come play the game, this is my name
Exciter
